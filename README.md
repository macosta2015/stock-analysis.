## Module 2: VBA of Wall Street


## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
#### This proejct is useful because it complements with our transition with macros. Now we know how to code macros by using visual basic. 
#### In addition to this, we are getting into programming. Visual basic provides all the features that other languages give such as loops, nested loops, for loops, etc. 

## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
#### It is possible to compare the performace between 2018 and 2017
##### 2017

## What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
### Refactoring code is essential for effiency and code reading. Not because the code runs it means that the code is proper. Later on we are going to be working with more complicated code and efficiency will mater (algorithms and data structures). Memory allocation is essential. 
### Refactoring also means to be consistent with the code. In a way it needs to look like a poem. If someone or you reads the code in 5 years/ 10 years, will the code be able to be understood. 
#### advantages: 
-The code will run more efficiently
-You will be able to read it easierly in the future

#### disadvantages
-It might take time to redo the code
-Some debugging will provably be needed

## How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
#### The code ran more efficiently. It took less time to run.
